# runbook-repeater

A simple yet powerful Python utility to generate executable shell runbooks from a template and a JSON parameter file.

## Overview

In many SRE and Ops environments, we often need to run similar scripts or "runbooks" with only minor variations in parameters like hostnames, user IDs, or configuration flags. Manually creating and editing these scripts for each use case is tedious and error-prone.

`runbook-repeater` solves this by automating the process. It takes a base shell script template and a JSON file with your specific parameters, and it generates a ready-to-run, executable script.

## Features

*   **Templating**: Generate customized scripts from a single, reusable template.
*   **Simple Placeholders**: Uses an easy-to-read `{{placeholder}}` syntax in templates.
*   **Structured Parameters**: Parameters are defined in a clean, structured JSON file.
*   **Auto-Executable**: Automatically makes the generated runbook executable (`chmod 755`), saving you a step.
*   **User-Friendly CLI**: Provides a clear command-line interface with help messages.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Catches common errors like missing files or invalid JSON.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3

## Usage

Using the generator is a simple three-step process:

### Step 1: Create a Template File

First, create a template file named `runbook_template.sh` in the same directory as the script. This file is a standard shell script, but with `{{key}}` placeholders for the values you want to customize.

**Example `runbook_template.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Runbook for service: {{service_name}}
# Target environment:  {{environment}}
# Generated on:        $(date)

echo "Starting deployment for {{service_name}}..."
echo "Deploying version: {{version}}"

# Simulate a deployment step
sleep 2
echo "Deployment complete for user {{user_id}}."

# A boolean check example
if [ "{{enable_monitoring}}" = "True" ]; then
  echo "Monitoring is enabled."
else
  echo "Monitoring is disabled."
fi
```

### Step 2: Create a Parameter File

Next, create a JSON file containing the key-value pairs for a specific runbook instance. The keys in the JSON file must match the placeholder names used in your template.

**Example `prod-deployment.json`:**
```json
{
  "service_name": "billing-api",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "v1.2.5",
  "user_id": "sre-team",
  "enable_monitoring": true
}
```

### Step 3: Generate the Runbook

Run the `generate_runbook.py` script, passing the parameter file and a name for your output script.

**Command:**
```bash
python3 generate_runbook.py prod-deployment.json deploy_prod_billing.sh
```

**Output:**
```
-> Reading parameters from: prod-deployment.json
-> Reading template from: runbook_template.sh
-> Writing generated runbook to: deploy_prod_billing.sh
-> Made script 'deploy_prod_billing.sh' executable.

âœ… Success! Your runbook is ready.
   To review: cat deploy_prod_billing.sh
   To run:    ./deploy_prod_billing.sh
```

### Step 4: Review and Execute

The generated script `deploy_prod_billing.sh` is now ready and executable. You can review its contents and run it directly.

**To review:**
```bash
cat deploy_prod_billing.sh
```

**To execute:**
```bash
./deploy_prod_billing.sh
```
